## Directions
- May need to run "./gradlew IntellijRuns" in the terminal
- May need to reload gradle projects by pressing refresh button in Gradle of right side bar of IntelliJ Idea IDE
### Use ParchmentMC for the following (https://parchmentmc.org/docs/getting-started):
- May need to add an id in plugins in build.gradle, change mapping values and mod values(YOU MUST CHANGE MOD VALUES SO IT DOES NOT INCLUDE MY NAME "SURYA GEDIPUDI")
- May need to add maven in settings.gradle
